COMMANDS THAT CAN BE RECEIVED

 - STOPPING THE DAEMON
    {"command":"quit"}
    shuts down all gameservers and stops the daemon

 - START A NEW GAME
    {"command":"start", "port":int, "game":"game", "install":bool, "params":"string"}
    starts a new game on port "port". "game" needs to be associated with a Poco in the config file.
    if "install" is set to true, the game will first get installed, then started.
    if "install" is set to false, the game will only be started. If the game isn't already installed,
    this will fail.
    "params" is a string of options that will passed as-is to the gameserver.

 - STOP A GAME
    {"command":"stop", "path":"/path/to/gameserver"}
    stops a game. "port" is the port of the server you want to stop. If "remove" is true, the gameserver
    will also get deleted.
